RESTful API an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. There are two API that can achieve this. One is SOAP ang the other is REST.

Advantages of REST API:
In addition to using HTTP for simplicity, REST offers a number of other benefits over SOAP:
-- REST allows a greater variety of data formats, whereas SOAP only allows XML.
-- Coupled with JSON (which typically works better with data and offers faster parsing), REST is generally considered easier to work with.
-- Thanks to JSON, REST offers better support for browser clients.
-- REST provides superior performance, particularly through caching for information that’s not altered and not dynamic.
-- It is the protocol used most often for major services such as Yahoo, Ebay, Amazon, and even Google.
-- REST is generally faster and uses less bandwidth.

This is a project implementing RESTful API using Jersey. There are two common ways to implement REST api. One is Jersey and the other is using Spring. The Spring implementation will be introduced in another project.
